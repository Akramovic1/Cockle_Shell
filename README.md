# Cockle_Shell - Simple Shell (Multi-Processing)

It is a Unix shell program. A shell is simply a program that conveniently allows you to run other programs.

The shell support the following commands:

1. The internal shell command "exit" which terminates the shell
    * **Concepts**: shell commands, exiting the shell.
    * **System calls**: exit()
2. A command with no arguments
    * **Example**: ls, cp, rm …etc
    * **Details**: Your shell must block until the command completes and, if the return code is abnormal, print out a message to that effect.
    * **Concepts**: Forking a child process, waiting for it to complete and synchronous execution.
    * **System calls**: fork(), execvp(), exit(), waitpid()
3. A command with arguments
    * **Example**: ls –l
    * **Details**: Argument 0 is the name of the command.
    * **Concepts**: Command-line parameters.
4. A command, with or without arguments, executed in the background using &.
    * **Example**: firefox &
    * **Details**: In this case, your shell must execute the command and return immediately, not blocking until the command finishes.
    * **Concepts**: Background execution, signals, signal handlers, processes and asynchronous execution.
    * **Requirements**: You have to show that the opened process will be nested as a child process to the shell program via opening the task manager found in the operating system like the one shown in figure 1. Additionally you have to write in a log file (basic text file) when a child process is terminated (main application will be interrupted by a SIGCHLD signal). So you have to implement an interrupt handler to handle this interrupt and do the corresponding action to it.
5. Shell builtin commands
    * **Commands**: cd & echo
    * **Details**: for the case of:
        * **cd**:
        * **echo**:
